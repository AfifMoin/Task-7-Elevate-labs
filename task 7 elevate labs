Task 7 :Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions 

Objective: Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.

Tools:Any web browser 
Deliverables: List of suspicious extensions found and removed (if any)


Firefox Extension Audit â€” Steps Taken
1. Opened the Brave extension
 I navigated to chrome://extensions/ to check the current extensions list.
2. Reviewed all installed extensions
 I found one extensions installed: Macfee WebAdviser. it visible in the list and enabled at the time of the review.

3. Checked permissions and developer reputation
 For each extension, I opened the Manage page and reviewed its permissions.
 No suspicious or unused extensions were present. installed add-ons served a clear privacy and security purpose and were frequently updated by verified developers.

   5. Removed suspicious or unnecessary extensions
 Since both extensions were safe, no removals were required. However, I noted that any untrusted or unnecessary extension would be removed at this stage to reduce risk and improve browser performance.

   6. Restarted the browser and verified settings
 After completing the audit, I restarted Brave to ensure the changes applied correctly. I checked that the default search engine, homepage, and notification settings were intact, and confirmed the browser was functioning normally.

   7. Researched risks of malicious extensions
 I learned that malicious extensions can harm users by injecting ads, stealing personal data, logging keystrokes, hijacking search results, or tracking browsing activity without consent. This highlights the importance of reviewing permissions carefully before installation.

   8. Documented steps and final results
 I captured screenshots of the chrome://extensions/ and the installed extensions for evidence. In my report, I documented that Brave was clean and secure with only one safe extensions installed, and no removals were necessary.
