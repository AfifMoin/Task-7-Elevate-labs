# Task-7 — Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
Audit installed browser extensions to ensure security, identify suspicious ones, and document findings clearly.

## Tools
- Firefox
- Web browser for research on extension risks
- Screenshots captured as evidence

---

## 1. Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager
- In Firefox: typed `about:addons` and clicked the **Extensions** tab to view all installed add-ons.
- In Chrome: navigated to `chrome://extensions/` to check the current extensions list.

## 2. Review all installed extensions
- Chrome: Listed all current extensions (details to be filled if any are installed).

## 3. Check permissions and reviews for each extension

- Chrome: Would review each extension’s details similarly (permissions, developer, ratings).

## 4. Identify any unused or suspicious extensions
- Firefox: No suspicious or unused extensions present.
- Chrome: Will flag any extensions with unknown developers, excessive permissions, or outdated/unreliable reviews.

## 5. Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions
- Firefox: No removal needed—both add-ons were safe and useful.
- Chrome: Remove or disable any that are unsafe or unneeded to reduce risk and improve performance.

## 6. Restart browser and check for performance improvements
- Restarted both browsers.
- Confirmed default settings (search engine, homepage, notifications) remained unchanged.
- Verified normal functionality and performance.

## 7. Research how malicious extensions can harm users
- Malicious add-ons may:
  - Track browsing and collect sensitive data
  - Inject unwanted ads or hijack searches
  - Log keystrokes or steal cookies
  - Compromise user privacy and security through updates

## Summary & Key Insights
- Regular audits of browser extensions are essential to maintain security.
- Trusted extensions with minimal permissions are acceptable; unknown or broad-permission add-ons should be reviewed or removed.
- Evidence in screenshots supports the audit process and findings clearly.
